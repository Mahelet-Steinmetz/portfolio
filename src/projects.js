    text: `For this brief, we had to design and hold our events. This event can be anything
    you want it to be but it has to be a 'specific, unique, and disputable purpose'
    (Priya Parker, The Art of Gathering). We had to then create a visual system for
    our event which could be a color palette, a specific typography on theme with
    your event, and other components like an invitation, decorations for the event,
    etc`,

    image: risoPoster,
    text: `For this brief, we designed a flexible visual system for a fictional city or
    “imaginary city” as Marco Polo describes in Italo Calvino's book, Invisible Cities.
    First, each student chose a random city from Invisible Cities out of a hatful of city
    names. Then we read the poem about our city and then began identifying words
    in the poem that characterized our city the best. From those words, I also chose
    images that corresponded as well as a color palette. My city was the City of
    Isaura and I decided to focus on its abundance of water as described on page 20
    of Calvinos, Invisible Cities. We then chose a phrase that best described our city
    and then used all of these elements to create 2 shapes or components which
    could be used to create a visual representation, in this case, a poster of our
    cities. Finally, we used these poster designs to print out a Riso book showcasing
    every student's visual system based on their city.`,

    image: typeFace,
    text: `For this project, create your own fonts based on an already existing one of our
    choosing. I chose Baskerville because I liked the way the stroke changed from
    thin and thick throughout the letterforms. We created our typeface by using the
    pen tool in illustrator to trace the letters in the original font so we had a basis to
    start from. Our typeface also had to fit within the alphabet seamlessly`,

    image: fashion,
    text: `We created an anthology that combined articles that we had picked based on our
    chosen topic. I chose to research fashion in different cultures and so the images
    and text throughout my anthology are from the articles I chose to work with. For
    this anthology, we also had to create a grid that best represented our information.`,

    image: poster,
    text: ` Every year our department has a Bachelor of Fine Arts Show where the seniors
    showcase their year-long study and art. So for this project, we created a specific
    visual identity that would act as the basic theme for a poster design. The poster
    had to have the name of the show, the time and place, and then creative aspects
    that represented your theme or identity. Then we had to create a presentation to
    present in front of the class and persuade them that our poster identity was the
    best one. At the end, we voted for our favorite and the winner had their poster
    showcased in the show.`,

    of letters of different parts or parts of the letter we decided to focus on. We then
    chose two Riso colors and printed them out in the Riso printer. The final product
    was a typo-texture stamp which we exchanged with our classmates.
