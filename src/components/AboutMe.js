        I’m in the process of receiving a BFA with a concentration in graphic
        design. My art journey began when I was little when my favorite way to
        spend my time was drawing in my sketchbook. Then as I grew up I
        continued to take art classes throughout middle school and high school.
        When I got to UConn and was deciding on a major concentration Graphic
        Design caught my interest the most because of my growing interest and
        awareness of digital art. I would describe myself as hard working,
        motivated, and persistent and I’m excited to use the skills I have
        developed to create art that can convey messages in a interesting and
        creative way to inspire others to think openly and differntly.
